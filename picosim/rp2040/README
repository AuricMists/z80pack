This is a Raspberry RP2040 research machine I have build on a breadboard.
For hardware description read:

	doc/README-pico.txt

If you don't want to build a machine your self, there are ready fabricated
systems on PCB available, which also can run the software. I have implemented
picosim on these:

	https://github.com/udo-munk/Pico-Eval-Board-80
	https://github.com/udo-munk/RP2040-GEEK-80


To build the software you need to have the SDK for RP2040-based devices
installed and configured. The SDK manual has detailed instructions how
to install on all major PC platforms, it is available here:

https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/microcontrollers/raspberry-pi-pico.html

Now you can build picosim with these commands:

	cd z80pack/picosim/rp2040
	mkdir build
	cd build
	cmake .. -G "Unix Makefiles"
	make

To clean everything:

	cd z80pack/picosim/rp2040
	rm -rf build

This machine can be used with Pico and Pico W boards, it is setup
for a Pico board. To setup for a Pico W comment/uncomment the lines
in CMakeLists.txt and change the board type in sim.h. It doesn't
really matter, on a Pico W the CYW43 gets intitialized but is not
used yet.

This is configured for USB UART so that no additional parts are needed
to hook up a terminal. If configured for GPIO UART connect a TTL/USB
adapter or a pico probe to the default UART pins for the board (GP0 & GP1).


Preparing a MicroSD card:
In the root directory of the card create these directories:
CONF80
CODE80
DISKS80

Into the CODE80 directory copy all the .bin files from src-examples.
Into the DISKS80 directory copy the disk images from disks.
CONF80 is used to save the configuration, nothing more to do there,
the directory must exist though.
